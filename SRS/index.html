                                <strong>1.4 Product Scope : </strong><br>
                                Our product will be a search cluster based product. In our product the user will be
                                able to create a search cluster according to their preference where the search cluster
                                consists of URLs and crawling strategies. Our product is similar to search engine
                                search, but here the URLs to be searched are controlled by the user and the contents
                                are scrapped and crawled according to their strategies. <br><br>

                                The self-contained and unique product provides users a medium to search for their necessary documents on the web. In this product, users will be able to create search clusters according to their preference. Search clusters consist of URLs and crawling strategies. Some crawling strategies include: All context, PDF only, DOC only, text files only and non-HTML content. The URLs bring content by the configured strategies and make it searchable for the user Similar to a search engine, where the URLs to be searched are controlled by the user and the contents are scrapped and crawled according to their strategies. <br><br>

                                <strong>2.3	User Classes and Characteristics : </strong><br>
                                The software will be used by admin and users. Users can Sign up for an account and Login. Users can create search clusters according to their preference The software requires users to Sign up and login to their account to create Search Clusters and Crawl data. Updates will take place in intervals once a cluster is created until the user deletes the cluster.
                                The administrator can add new crawling strategies. The administrator has control over database and functions. The administrator is responsible for product maintenance, server management, security management and system updates.
                                The program can be accessed by both web and mobile app by any user who has an account. <br><br>

                                <strong>•	Mobile app: </strong> Operating system with Android 6 or above <br><br>

                                <strong>2.5	Design and Implementation Constraints : </strong><br>
                                  The system’s designed is based on Django web framework and Java for Android(both very flexible). REST API is used to connect with any platforms. One of the most popular applications for MySQL database management, phpMyAdmin, is used here. The product will be unusable if an internet connection is not used since it is a necessity for both mobile application and web interference. A list of other limits include: <br>
                                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    i. hardware limitations <br>

                                <strong>2.6	User Documentation : </strong><br>
                                  The system is designed to be informative and user-friendly. For any further questions, the user can look into user manual and video tutorial. <br><br>
                                  
                                <strong>2.7	Assumptions and Dependencies : </strong><br>
                                The system requires an internet connection for both mobile application and web interface. An Android smart phone is required for the voice recognition feature in the app.

                            Our product's first priority is to have a “User Friendly” website. In our website,
                            when a user opens the website firstly they will be redirected to the home page where the user
                            is a new user they can register or else, if they have an account they can log in using their Email
                            and password. They can also log in and register using their Google account. There will also be
                            an option where admin can log in and when an admin logs in they will be redirected to the
                            Admin panel, where admins can manage all their works. In our product homepage, there will also be
                            information about the development team and also about the product. From the homepage they can go to the
                            cluster creation page and search page. From the search page after searching using keyword/s 
                            they will be redirected to the search results page. Also from the homepage, a user can
                            have all the information about the product and developer team and contact them if needed.
                            The following figures illustrate examples for a possible GUI of our product : <br><br>

                            We require many types of software programs. We also require various platforms, framework,
                            Languages. They are- <br>
                            1.REST API. <br>

                            We will use Rest API for server and user communication. The android application will send the audio to Google’s Could server which was given by the user to analyze and will receive the text data which has been recognized in the audio. It will also send text to receive Audio data from Google’s Text-to-speech sever. This will all be done via HTTP requests, and the audio and data transferred are encrypted by Google’s technology.

                            <br>
                            Response Time: The duration to perform simple task includes database access, form fill out and more.
                            If the internet connection is stable, accessing the database will not take more than 2 seconds.

                            <br>
                            1.	The transmission of information to the database has to be secured by the addition of encryption.<br>
                            2.	Personal information of a user can be accessed by only respective user.<br>
                            3.	All the information stored in the database will be secure.<br>

                            The system will take necessary steps in protecting any personal information of the user. Any information required by the system will be taken by complete consent of the user. A few steps to be implemented for security requirements are listed below:<br>
                            1.	Users are allowed only three attempts at password before the system shuts them out. Therefore, making it difficult for hackers to guess the password.<br>
                            2.	Encryption will guarantee safe data transmission across apps.<br>
                            3.	Third parties will not have any access to user’s personal information

                            Portability: Any mobile device and web browser can have access to the software.<br>

                            Testability: Unit tests will take place to save time and money. Unit tests catch flaws early in the development cycle and helps developer in understanding code base to make quick changes.<br>
